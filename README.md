# Challenge, week 1: Refactor starter code

## In this project I was tasked to take starter code for a company website and refactor it for accessibility and search engine optimization.

### To begin I changed several general ```<div>``` elements to more specific semantic html elements. These changes required adjusting the css code to reflect the changes from ```<div class=x>``` to the html element names. 

### Next, I added `alt` tags to the images on the page where possible and desired. The hero image is part of the css background so an `alt` tag wasn't possible for that image and the small images in the right side column are decorative so I put null `alt` tags there to allow screen readers to skip those images. 

### Finally, I addressed the css code to increase logical flow and efficiency and decrease repetition by combining and reusing class elements wherever possible.

##### For this class assignment a Table of COntents, Installation Instructions, Usage information, Credits, License information, Badges, Features, and Tests are not necessary but I'd like to acknowledge that those would be included here when pertinent.
