# Challenge, week 1: Refactor starter code

## In this project I was tasked to take starter code for a company website and refactor it for accessibility and search engine optimization.

### To these ends, I changed several general <div> elements to more specific semantic html elements. These changes required adjusting the css code to reflect the changes from <div class=x> to the html element names. Next, I added alt tags to the images on the page where possible and practical. The hero image is part of the css background so an alt tag wasn't possible for that image and the small images in the right side column are decorative so I put null alt tags there to allow screen readers to skip those images. Finally, I addressed the css code to increase logical flow and efficiency and decrease repetition by combining and reusing class elements wherever possible.
